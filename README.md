# Hello, I'm Wagih! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

## About Me

I'm on an exciting journey of transitioning from the world of procurement to becoming a full stack engineer. With over 5 years of expertise in procurement, I have developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills. Now, I'm channeling my passion for technology and coding into becoming a well-rounded full stack engineer.

## My Learning Path

- Currently, I am actively learning various technologies, frameworks, and programming languages to enhance my skills in web development.
- I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge in front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as diving into back-end technologies like Node.js and databases.
- Along the way, I'm also exploring modern frameworks such as React and Express to build dynamic and responsive web applications.

## What You'll Find Here

- On my GitHub, you'll find projects and repositories showcasing my progress and growth as a full stack engineer.
- I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals, contribute to open source projects, and learn from the vibrant developer community.
